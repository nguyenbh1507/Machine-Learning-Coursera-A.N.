Hello all! I hope everyone has been enjoying the course and learning a lot! This week, you will be learning about unsupervised learning. While supervised learning algorithms need labeled examples (x,y), unsupervised learning algorithms need only the input (x). You will learn about clusteringâ€”which is used for market segmentation, text summarization, among many other applications.
We will also be introducing Principal Components Analysis, which is used to speed up learning algorithms, and is sometimes incredibly useful for visualizing and helping you to understand your data.
As always, if you get stuck on the quiz and programming assignment, you should post on the Discussions to ask for help. (And if you finish early, I hope you'll go there to help your fellow classmates as well.)
